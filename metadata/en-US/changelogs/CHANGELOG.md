# CHANGELOG

# Release 2.1
Refactor: remove telephony permissions, modernize service for Android 14, and implement log-based brightness scaling.

# Release 2.0
Refactor brightness calculation with log interpolation: switching from plain linear interpolation in lux space to a non-linear mapping that will feel much better to users because human perception of brightness is roughly logarithmic.

# Release 1.1
This represents the initial fork of the [Auto-Shine](https://github.com/Valent-in/Auto-Shine) project. It introduces a rebranded name and logo, alongside minor UI enhancements within the settings menu.

The original release of [Auto-Shine](https://github.com/Valent-in/Auto-Shine) project made by [Valent-in](https://github.com/Valent-in).
